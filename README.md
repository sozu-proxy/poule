# A growable pool of reusable values

(originally based on the [pool crate](https://crates.io/crates/pool))

A Rust library providing a pool structure for managing reusable values.
All values in the pool are initialized when the pool is created. Values
can be checked out from the pool at any time. When the checked out value
goes out of scope, the value is returned to the pool and made available
for checkout at a later time.

The pool can allocate memory as need, up to a maximum number of elements.
Growing the pool does not require copying or moving memory.
